          The day begins with a morning assembly featuring prayers from different religions. A daily Restorative Justice circle helps build community within the classroom and empowers students to understand, address and repair harm through dialogue. In terms of academics, subject-specific classes are designed to seamlessly integrate the 4Cs of learning. A structured sports curriculum teaches students specific skills required for various team games. Weekly music, cooking, art and library classes keep the school week interesting.
