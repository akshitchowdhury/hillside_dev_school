            We believe that learning should be a joyful experience and that childhood should be about exploration and play. Thatâ€™s why we do not assign students homework until Class 4. Built on the foundation of quality education,  our Primary school program offers students an experiential learning environment that ensures all-round development.

            Circle time continues to strengthen the bonds formed at preschool. At the primary level, most learning is activity-based, with students working individually or in groups. Daily fun on the field involves learning the skills required to excel at  specific sports and games. Life skills, discussion of news and bonding with senior buddies during lunch hour round out the day. Weekly art and craft, computer, and library sessions hone creativity, technology, and informational skill sets.
